    "text": "HPVsim is a flexible agent-based model for simulation HPV transmission and progression through cervical disease to cancer. The model can be parameterized with country-specific vital dynamics, structured sexual networks, co-transmitting HPV genotypes, B- and T-cell mediated immunity, and high-resolution disease natural history. HPVsim is designed with a user-first lens: it is implemented in pure Python, has built-in tools for simulating commonly-used interventions, has been extensively tested and documented, and runs in a matter of seconds to minutes on a laptop."

Since this represents a significant shift, version 3.0 and above will live in a separate repository. The code in this repository will be frozen after version 2.2, aside from any critical bugfixes."
